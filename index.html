            <p>
            My name is Andrew Bayles and I am a junior applying to the Informatics Major this spring. I have taken over 40 credits of informatics courses including the maximum 10 credits of core classes allowed to outside students.  I am tenacious about my future and I know that this class is important to my future. My role in the class is as the information manager. While the specifics of the role have yet to be explained to me I am excited to be in a management role because I have much experience managing projects and leading people.

            <h1>ISIS at Comic Con</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
            The current level of terror that exists in our media today makes this prompt quite a relevant topic to our subject. However a completely virtual conference venue can be abstracted to make these prestigious events more accessible to a whole new population of attendees no matter where people are located nor what the conference is about. However that idea is for a later time. If Comic Con was the first of its kind to be hosted in a virtual realm it would have to focus on achieving the goal of making people experience the flow of being at a stunningly large convention such as comic con. The experience of the hustle and bustle of being there with thousands of people excitingly shuffling through the endless stands, events, and panels. Being able to interact with the other people is another huge portion of going to conventions, talking about common interest is the whole reason we are social creatures. Finally you would need to make it accessible to people so to ensure one of the most massive conglomeration of people in a virtual space to set a new convention record. If these three objectives could be completed then the experience could be appropriately brought into the virtual realm.

            <h1>Naming Conventions & Terminology Table</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
            For my file structure I will be using naming that will make it easy to always access exactly what you need no matter the amount of objects you possess in SL. Every file will begin with i467studios and every space in between words will be  represented with an underscore. The second part of the name will be department that it belongs to in terms of use. The third portion will be the name of the avatar that created it making it easy to find other's objects that you contain inside your inventory. The fourth portion of the name will be the name that describes best what the object is.


            </p>
            <h3>Terminology Table</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>

            <ul>
                <li>Ways of displaying information: Flash cards, signs, video, HUD, Mini-map, AI characters</li>

            I am responsible for how information is displayed to the guests in world at V-con.  It is up to me to decide what we want to inform our guests upon arrival so that they understand their place in v-con. It's important to ensure that we don't overload our guests with too much information but we also want to make sure that they are not lost in the world either. In the end it is up to me to make sure the guest is well informed and excited for the possibilities open to them at V-Con.

            <h2>Tools</h2>
            
            <p>
                	My responsibility is designing the way of displaying and informing our participants with the environment and making sure they are constantly aware of where they are within V-Con. I am going to need to design where and how the information is conveyed. In order to communicate this effectively I am going to use Omnigrapple to build a easy to change layout of when, where, and how information about V-con is displayed. Omnigrapple is a tool that allows for complicated charts to be made but It can be utilized to make a map of V-con and use labels to explain the exact experience in a 2-D layout of the venue. 

            </p>
            
            <h2>Skills & Techniques</h2>
            <p>	
                Concepts that I want to implement into the design of displaying and giving information to people is Interactivity Contrast as explained in chapter 4 of designing virtual worlds. I want some information to be automatically interactive, meaning that the user has no choice about triggering the event it is going to happen to everyone in V-con. It's counterpart is known as manual interactivity which means that the avatar has to decide to interact with an object before triggering an event. A combination of these kinds of interactivity is going to create the most pleasurable way of receiving information 
            </p>
            <h2>Tasks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design Layout of information displays finished by 4/28</li>
                <li>Figure out what users need to know about v-con and start assembling all information that will be given to users 4/28</li>
                <li>Build prototypes of information displays 3/5</li>
                <li>Ensure automatic interactivity and manual interactivity are integral to the displaying and giving of information 3/5</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Dependencies</h2>
            <p>
            I am dependent on the physical layout of V-con to be decided before I can start planning how, when, and where information is displayed to the avatars in V-con. I am also relying on the 2d and 3d design to finish the designs of information displays that I will discuss with him. If they are too busy I feel confident that I could design a lot of the 3-D and 2-D models myself since my responsibility has limited scope.
