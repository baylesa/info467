            <p>
            My name is Andrew Bayles and I am a junior applying to the Informatics Major this spring. I have taken over 40 credits of informatics courses including the maximum 10 credits of core classes allowed to outside students.  I am tenacious about my future and I know that this class is important to my future. My role in the class is as the information manager. While the specifics of the role have yet to be explained to me I am excited to be in a management role because I have much experience managing projects and leading people.

            <h1>ISIS at Comic Con</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
            The current level of terror that exists in our media today makes this prompt quite a relevant topic to our subject. However a completely virtual conference venue can be abstracted to make these prestigious events more accessible to a whole new population of attendees no matter where people are located nor what the conference is about. However that idea is for a later time. If Comic Con was the first of its kind to be hosted in a virtual realm it would have to focus on achieving the goal of making people experience the flow of being at a stunningly large convention such as comic con. The experience of the hustle and bustle of being there with thousands of people excitingly shuffling through the endless stands, events, and panels. Being able to interact with the other people is another huge portion of going to conventions, talking about common interest is the whole reason we are social creatures. Finally you would need to make it accessible to people so to ensure one of the most massive conglomeration of people in a virtual space to set a new convention record. If these three objectives could be completed then the experience could be appropriately brought into the virtual realm.
